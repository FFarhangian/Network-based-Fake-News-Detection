# Network-based-Fake-News-Detection
The rise of social media and online platforms has made it easier than ever for fake news to spread and reach a larger audience, posing a significant threat to public opinion and democratic processes. Researchers have developed various methods to detect fake news, with social context-based methods, including network-based fake news detection, gaining significant attention in recent years. By examining the relationships between news articles and the users who share them, network-based methods can provide insight into the social dynamics of fake news dissemination and help to identify key actors and sources of misinformation. Researchers use a range of tools and techniques, such as graph theory, complex network analysis, and machine learning, to construct and analyze networks of news articles and users. One such approach involves constructing friendship networks based on user interactions and comparing the properties of these networks to identify fake news. In this paper, we use friendship network modeling to detect fake news and identify unique characteristics associated with its propagation. This pattern recognition approach can help to develop effective strategies to combat the spread of fake news in online communities.

# Methodology
We will focus on using network-level descriptors to compare the characteristics of fake news networks and true news networks. Our aim is to identify popular patterns that can help distinguish between these two types of networks. Our metrics have been designed to capture the characteristics of the networks at the network level, including measures such as number of nodes, number of edges, average closeness centrality, average betweenness centrality, average page rank score, average geodesic distance, density, network diameter, transitivity, and assortativity. By focusing on network-level descriptors, we can gain insights into the overall structure and complexity of the networks, and identify areas of difference between fake news and true news networks. By comparing these characteristics, we hope to identify key differences between fake news and true news networks and provide a basis for developing effective strategies for identifying and combating fake news.
